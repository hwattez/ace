/**
 * This package contains many classes representing various types of constraints. Constraints can be defined
 * extensionally (by means of tables or MDDs), intensionally (by means of general Boolean tree expressions, which often
 * correspond to classical forms called primitives), or from a well-known template (so-called global constraints).
