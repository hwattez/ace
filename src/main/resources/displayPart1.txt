To run AbsCon, you must use a command like:
  java abscon.Resolution {<problem>} <problemParameters> <solverParameters>

  <problem> is the name of a class that extends Problem. Some of such classes are put in subfolders of the folder problems
	For example, we can find the subfolders acad, patt, real and xcsp.
	So possibilities for <problem> are for example problems.acad.Queens, problems.real.Crossword and problems.xcsp.ProblemXCSP.
	<problem> is optionnal, in which case, we have problems.xcsp3.XCSP3 as a default value.

  <problemParameters> is the list of parameters (separated by whitespace) specific for the chosen problem.
	For problems.acad.Queens, this list is composed of two integers.
	For problems.xcsp3.XCSP3, this is the name of a file (potentially compressed with bz2) representing an instance in format XCSP3

  <solverParameters> is the list of parameters  (separated by whitespace) used for solving the instance.
	Any such parameter is of the form -name=value (potentially -name for some flag parameters).
	The different parameters and their values are listed below.
