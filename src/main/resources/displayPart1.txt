To run ACE (AbsCon Essence), you must use a command like:
  java ace <xcsp3Instance> <options>

  <xcsp3Instance> is the name of a file containing an XCSP3 instance
  
  <options> is the list of options  (separated by whitespace) used for solving the instance.
	Any such parameter is of the form -name=value (potentially -name for some flag parameters).
	The different parameters and their values are listed below.
