By the way, there are also two other optional (command line) parameters that can be put just after ace: 
  java ace {settingsFile} {nInstances} <xcsp3Instance> <solverOptions>

  <nInstances> is the number of instances to be solved.

  <settingsFile> is the name of a XML file that contains the settings for some solver options.
	For example, you can generate such a file with a command like : java dashboard.ControlPanel

Let us consider some examples:

  java ace queens-12.xml -s=10
	The instance queens-12.xml is solved (but the solve is stopped after 10 found solutions).

  java ace queens-12.xml -s=10 -varh=Dom 
	The instance queens-12.xml is solved using the variable ordering heuristic 'min Dom'.

  java ace scen11-f8.xml -r_n=1000 -r_c=10
	The instance scen11-f8.xml.
	The solver will restart up to 1000 times, and the cutoff value that is used for determining the moment the solver has to restart is initially set to 10 (backtracks).
	The cutoff value is increased at each restart by a factor set to 1.1 (default value).
  
  java ace mac.xml queens-12.xml -s=10
	The instance queens-12.xml is solved using the configuration set in the XML file called mac.xml (but -s=10 has the priority).

  java main.HeadExtraction scen11-f8.xml
	A minimal unsatisfiable core is extracted: this core is in the file 'extraction_0_xx.xml' where xx stands for the highest value among all (intermediate) generated files.
